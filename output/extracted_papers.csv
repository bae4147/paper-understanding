3544549.3585619,3544549.3585619.pdf,Drumming Human-machine Integrated,"STAMPER enables drummers to generate innovative performances by controlling multiple bass drums. STAMPER consists of several “Actuated Pedals (APs),” bass drum pedals embedded with an EC motor, paired with bass drums, and a machine vision system. The APs are used both as input and output. One AP in input mode senses the position of the pedal being used by the drummer. Other APs in actuated mode respond to the input mode AP’s motion. Machine vision is used to monitor the drummer’s movements to control the behavior of the actuated APs. In this paper, we describe the current prototype of STAMPER and what kind of drum performances can be achieved with the system by reporting a study conducted with an experienced drummer.","Drumming Human-machine Integrated [SEP] STAMPER enables drummers to generate innovative performances by controlling multiple bass drums.

Most of the communication between patients and their treat- ment team involves brief verbal exchanges within a clinical setting, which is not necessarily conducive to the needs of the patient in their daily life. In this research, we sought to identify methods by which chatbot technology could be used to enhance treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD). We also sought to establish an alter- native communication medium by which to engage in digestible daily interactions with AUD patients (to monitor the psychological state of the user) as well as their companions (to make them aware of important events and coach them in their interactions with the user).","Exploring the Challenges and Opportunities in Developing Systems to Improve Alcohol Use Disorder through Chatbot Technology [SEP] Alcohol use disorder is a debilitating psychiatric condition, which can have devastating effects on the individual, their friends, and family.

We present the Offset-Adjusted SImilarity Score (OASIS), a real-time method of detecting similarity which we show working on visual detection of Duchenne smile between a pair of users. We conduct a user study survey (N = 27) to measure a user-based interoperability score on smile similarity and compare the user score with OASIS as well as the rolling window Pearson correlation and the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method. Ulti- mately, our results indicate that our algorithm has intrinsic qualities comparable to the user score and measures well to the statistical correlation methods.

However, there were rarely any work in creativity research that harnessed the design ideas gener­ ated by such models directly for design space exploration. To that end we designed a digital mood board as a technology probe to support semantically-enhanced exploration of the StyleGAN latent space.

Preliminary results showed that such design ofered a more enjoyable and explicit way of exploring AI generated visual ideas, but gallery display was found to be more straightforward and less demanding.","Digital Exploration Investigating [SEP] During past decades, Artifcial Intelligence (AI) has been consis­ tently used in Creativity Support Tools (CSTs).

To this end, we propose a novel method for cross-device input arbitration based on the relative orientation be­ tween the HMD and target device as measured by on-device IMUs.

This work presents a PTSD intervention delivered through a mobile application designed based on evidence-based treatment principles, particularly cognitive restructuring. Rather than implementing traditional resource-intensive PTSD treatments, the app employs brief, daily, game-like interactions to train users to develop more adaptive perspectives of themselves, others, and the world. The app’s text-based interactions incorporate three key mechanisms: directional swiping gestures for thought categoriza- tion, paired statement tasks with immediate animated feedback, and emoji-based labeling to reduce cognitive load during. These interaction patterns were designed to maintain therapeutic fidelity while leveraging familiar mobile interface conventions. Analysis of multiple assessments on the validated PCL-5 measure showed 28.1% achieved clinically reliable improvement (≥18 point reduc- tion). These findings suggest that engagement with brief mobile interactions, designed based on evidence based techniques, may effectively reduce PTSD symptoms through digital platforms.","Gamifying Mental Health Treatment: A Mobile Interface Design for PTSD Intervention [SEP] Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) treatment faces significant accessibility challenges, with only 30-40% of diagnosed individuals receiving care.
